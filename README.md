# Image-Processing-Filters-in-Python

Image processing is any form of data processing in which the input and output are images such as photographs or video frames. Unlike image processing, which is only concerned with manipulating figures for their final representation, image processing is a stage for new data processing such as machine learning or pattern recognition. Most techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal, to which signal processing standards are applied.

<strong>Sketch:</strong></br>
A sketch is a quickly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Contrast:</strong></br>
Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an object (or its representation in an image or screen) distinguishable. For this filter, the PIL library was used.
