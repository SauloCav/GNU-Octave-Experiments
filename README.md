# Image-Processing-Filters-in-Python

Image processing is any form of data processing in which the input and output are images such as photographs or video frames. Unlike image processing, which is only concerned with manipulating figures for their final representation, image processing is a stage for new data processing such as machine learning or pattern recognition. Most techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal, to which signal processing standards are applied.

<strong>Sketch:</strong></br>
A sketch is a quickly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Contrast:</strong></br>
Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an object (or its representation in an image or screen) distinguishable. For this filter, the PIL library was used.

<strong>Black and White:</strong></br>
Black and white images (B/W or B&W) combine black and white in a continuous spectrum, producing a variety of shades of gray. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Blur:</strong></br>
In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Brightness:</strong></br>
Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. For this filter, the PIL library was used.

<strong>Cartoon:</strong></br>
A cartoon is a humorous drawing, animated or not. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but modern usage generally refers to: an image or series of images intended for humor. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Cool:</strong></br>

<strong>Edge Detection:</strong></br>

<strong>Negative:</strong></br>

<strong>Saturation:</strong></br>

<strong>Vintage:</strong></br>
