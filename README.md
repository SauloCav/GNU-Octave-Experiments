# Image Processing Filters in Python

Image processing is any form of data processing in which the input and output are images such as photographs or video frames. Unlike image processing, which is only concerned with manipulating figures for their final representation, image processing is a stage for new data processing such as machine learning or pattern recognition.

<strong>Sketch:</strong></br>
A sketch is a quickly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Contrast:</strong></br>
Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an object (or its representation in an image or screen) distinguishable. For this filter, the PIL library was used.

<strong>Black and White:</strong></br>
Black and white images (B/W or B&W) combine black and white in a continuous spectrum, producing a variety of shades of gray. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Blur:</strong></br>
In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Brightness:</strong></br>
Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. For this filter, the PIL library was used.

<strong>Cartoon:</strong></br>
A cartoon is a humorous drawing, animated or not. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but modern usage generally refers to: an image or series of images intended for humor. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Cool:</strong></br>
Cool filter reduces the temperature of the image bringing more bluish tones. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Edge Detection:</strong></br>
Edge detection is an image processing and computer vision technique to determine points in a digital image where the light intensity changes suddenly. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Negative:</strong></br>
In photography, a negative is an image in which the lighter areas of the photographed subject appear darker and the darker areas appear lighter. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.

<strong>Saturation:</strong></br>
Saturation is a parameter that specifies the quality of a color hue by the degree to which the hue blends with the white color. For this filter, the PIL library was used.

<strong>Vintage:</strong></br>
Vintage filters bring an image treatment reminiscent of old images. For this filter, the cv2 library was used.
