# Image-Processing-Filters-in-Python

Image processing is any form of data processing in which the input and output are images such as photographs or video frames. Unlike image processing, which is only concerned with manipulating figures for their final representation, image processing is a stage for new data processing such as machine learning or pattern recognition. Most techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal, to which signal processing standards are applied.
